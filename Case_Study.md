### Case Study - Statements

### Problem 1:

Suppose an organization pays their employees on a monthly basis. The salary of each of its employees is tallied in an XML file for each month. But now the management wants to upgrade their salary tally software. According to the new requirements, the new software must perform following things:

a. If an employee is not present during a month award them zero salaries.

b. If a particular month is not present in the salary XML file, award zero salaries for that as well.

c. Extract the salaries of each employee for the year 2015 and 2016 in two separate Excel files.

Now, using Talend Open Studio for DI, generate a solution for it.
